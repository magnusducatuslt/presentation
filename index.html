            <p>
              A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed and public digital
              ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers
              so that any involved record cannot be altered retroactively,
              without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.

            <h2>Block?!</h2>
            <p>
              Blocks hold batches of valid transactions that are hashed and
              encoded into a Merkle tree. Each block includes the cryptographic
              hash of the prior block in the blockchain, linking the two. The
              linked blocks form a chain. This iterative process confirms the
              integrity of the previous block, all the way back to the original
              genesis block.

            <p>
              Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a
              timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle
              tree)

            <p>
              By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data.
              It is an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions
              between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent
              way.
            </p>

          <section>
            <img src="./lib/images/p2p.jpg" />
            <p>
              For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed
              by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for
              inter-node communication and validating new blocks.
            </p>

              src="./lib/images/network-validation.png"
            />
            <p>
              Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered
              retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks, which
              requires consensus of the network majority.

              Every transaction is first verified before being added to the
              blockchain. Once added, they cannot be modified by any means. It

              peer-to-peer consensus algorithm.</span

            <p>
              Federated blockchain, you’ll get a decentralized private
              environment.In federated blockchain instead of one organization
              maintaining the network, there would be multiple organizations who
              will take decision making role. The presence of multiple parties
              on the network establishes the decentralized structure of the
              federated blockchain.
